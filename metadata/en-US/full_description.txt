[Tasker][1] is a very useful and widely used automation app for Android with a
plugin architecture that allows other apps (such as this one) to add extra
functionality.

This app provides the following actions for use within Tasker:

 - Generate Private Key - Generates a private key to use for SSH authentication
 - Get Public Key - Retrieves a public key from a previously generated private
   key and returns it in the variable `%pubkey`
 - rsync - Run an rsync command to synchronise files to or from the device
 - dbclient - Run an SSH command non-interactively (experimental)

The packaged native binaries of [Dropbear][2] and [rsync][3] are my own builds
which I keep updated with new releases.

Reasons for requested permissions:

 - `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`  
   Run actions for more than a short time when triggered from older versions of
   Tasker.
 - `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`  
   (Android 14+) Run actions for more than a short time when triggered from
   older versions of Tasker.
 - `INTERNET`  
   Allow connecting to SSH servers (even if the SSH server is on your local
   network Android prevents connections without this permission).
 - `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`  
   (Android 11+) To read or write the files on your device with rsync.
 - `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`  
   (Android 10 and below) To read or write the files on your device with rsync.
 - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`  
   Show a notification that a new version is available (if checking for updates
   is enabled).
 - `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`  
   Prompt to install an update after you have tapped on the update notification
   and chosen 'Download'.
